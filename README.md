## Introduction

The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time. This repository aims to provide comprehensive solutions and simulations for 1D and 2D Schrödinger equations.

## Project Structure

- **1D_Schrodinger**: Solutions and simulations for one-dimensional Schrödinger equations.
- **2D_Schrodinger**: Solutions and simulations for two-dimensional Schrödinger equations.
- **utils**: Utility functions and scripts used across the projects.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/legaroid/SchrodingerEqProjects.git
```
## Usage

Navigate to the project directory you are interested in (e.g., `1D_Schrodinger` or `2D_Schrodinger`) and follow the instructions provided in the README files within each project.
